## About

The Bear Project is dedicated to understanding bears in the wild and showcasing their significance to ecosystems. This project collects information on various bear species, simulates bear-related data (e.g., tracking movements or behaviors), and visualizes data to help people learn more about these majestic animals.

Whether you're learning about bears in general or building simulations to analyze their behavior, this project is a great place to start!

## Features

- **Bear Species Database**: A collection of data on various bear species, including grizzly bears, polar bears, and pandas.
- **Behavior Simulation**: Models and simulates bear behaviors in different environments.
- **Interactive Visualization**: View bear habitats, migration paths, and more.
- **Educational Resources**: Learn about bear conservation, threats to their population, and how we can help.

## Usage

Once the project is running, you can explore the interactive features:

- View detailed information about different bear species.
- Run simulations on bear movement or behavior.
- Visualize tracking data in a map or graph.

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different parameters to see how bears behave in different environments.
